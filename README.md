# Sudoku online
Hey there! This project is a MERN stack website where you can play Sudoku! <br/>
I deployed it online thanks to [render.com](https://render.com/), and you can find it [here](https://sudokuonline.onrender.com)!<br />
## Functionalities
The website offers:
- 4 different difficutlies for the Sudoku.
- Playing as a guest, or create an account.
- With the account, you can keep track of how manu grids you have solved, and of what difficulty.
- MongoDB database for storing the account's information.
- Don't worry, all the password are safely stored using bCrypt hash algorithm, as you can see from the code.
- Logout and delete account.
<br />

The grids are backend-generated by a simple backtracking algorithm. Also don't worry, the solution is guaranteed to be unique! <br />
The website is responsive, so you can play on it from different devices without any worries! <br />
There are four difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme), so everyone can play having fun based on his skill level. <br />
Have fun!
